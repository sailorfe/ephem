# chart

**chart** is a minimal, opinionated, and configurable horoscope CLI designed with electional astrology and premodern revivalism in mind. `chart now` calculates the chart of the moment relative for your locale, while `chart cast` accepts input for specific dates like nativities and other past and future events.

pair with [ascendant](https://codeberg.org/sailorfe/ascendant) for an efficient scriptable clock ü§ì

lat = 36.0              # N is positive, S is negative
lng = -86.0             # E is positive, W is negative

[display]
classical = False       # set with --classical or -c
brief = False           # set with --brief or -b
verbose = False         # set with --verbose or -v
no-color = False        # set with --no-color or -m
no-angles = False       # set with --no-angles or -z
no-coordinates = False  # set with --no-coordinates or -p
node = true             # not a boolean! this is a string; other option is 'mean'
```
