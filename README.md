a minimal, opinionated astrology CLI tool

[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ephem-cli.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ephem-cli/) [![license: agpl v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-agpl--3-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

</div>


`ephem` is a linux-native cli for astrologers, built on hellenistic tradition with electional and horary practice in mind. it generates horoscopes and monthly ephemerides with professional accuracy, and stores time and geodata in a local database that can be edited as YAML files.

currently supports:
- all 47 sidereal offsets from the [Swiss Ephemeris](https://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephprg.htm)
- the sun, moon, and eight planets (mercuryâ€“pluto)
- choice of lunar node calculation method
- clear table output for charts and ephemerides
- graceful handling of incomplete data

deliberately out of scope:
- house cusps and placements
- graphical charts
- asteroids

pip install -e .
```

### testing

pip install ephem-cli \
  --pip-args="--index-url https://codeberg.org/api/packages/sailorfe/pypi/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple --pre"
```

```sh
# with pipx
pipx install ephem-cli \
  --pip-args="--index-url https://codeberg.org/api/packages/sailorfe/pypi/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple --pre"
```

<a name="usage"></a>
## usage

```sh
ephem {now,cast,cal,data}
```

- `now` and `cast` to calculate and optionally save charts
- `cal` to calculate monthly ephemerides
- `data` to interact with chart database

<a name="examples"></a>
### examples

get a chart for right now:
```sh
ephem now
```

save your location to avoid typing coordinates every time:
```sh
ephem now -y 30 -x -80 --save-config
```

cast a chart for a specific date and time:
```sh
ephem cast 1996-08-26 17:20 "Jeon Soyeon" -z Asia/Seoul -y 37.488167 -x 127.085472
```

get a monthly ephemeris:
```sh
ephem cal 1989 dec
```

### tutorial

for more detailed examples, see [the ephem tutorial](./docs/00-tutorial.md).

<a name="testing"></a>
## testing

`ephem` has a test suite. run it with:

```sh
make test
```

these tests currently focus on CLI behavior and database interactions since core calculations are handled by the Swiss Ephemeris library. more tests are planned as the project grows.

## contributing

`ephem` is in early development. contributions are welcome, especially from developers with experience in astrology software, but what it *really* needs at this stage is testers. [join the humble discord server](https://discord.gg/b3vA5ZhSu2)!
