# The Ephem Tutorial

"Astrology is alive."[^1] Everything has a birth chart, and computing and social media self-surveillance make it exceptionally easy to keep track of dates and times. For example, this application's first Git commit can be considered its birth or inception:

```sh
commit 7587dc9634fd682a5a1b40da0f4e54498d34adde
Author: sailorfe <sailorfe@proton.me>
Date:   Wed Aug 6 13:57:13 2025 -0400
    initial
```

Its chart generated with *itself* (whew) is

```sh
Ephem (Tropical)
2025-08-06 13:57:13 UTC

```

This tutorial assumes astrological literacy but not necessarily command-line experience. Some resources I recommend:

- [Learn enough command line to be dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics)
- [Introduction to the command line](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html)

By the end, you will have set your default location, saved your own birth chart, elected an event, and answered a horary question, all in the terminal.
