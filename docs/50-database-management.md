## Database Management

Besides the `--save` option to `now` and `cast`, the `data` command lets you interact with your saved chart database. It has the following subcommands:

- `data view`: View database.
- `data load N`: Re-generate a chart from saved input data.
- `data delete N`: Delete chart.
- `data sync`: Sync YAML charts with database; see [Advanced Usage](./60-advanced-usage.md).

Each chart in your database has a unique integer ID that you will need to know to interact with your charts. The first command you should run is `data view`.

- You can store as many charts as your local storage allows, but scrolling through the output can get tedious.
- The ID #'s are permanent. If you delete charts 2-4, the sequence will look like `1, 5`. This is fine! (she said with a Virgo moon)
